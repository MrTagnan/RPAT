\## V0.5 - A New Input

\### Added

* Terminal based input system created
* Support for manual input for booster-less rockets
* Initial groundwork started for JSON based presets
* Updated README.md



\### Notes:
Subsequent updates will NOT include /Example Scripts, this was a placeholder for the json presets before it existed, therefore it will be made redundant with the expansion of rockets.json.
